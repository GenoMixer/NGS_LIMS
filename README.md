# NGS_LIMS
The NGS_LIMS is a Perl based mySQL database management system for storing sample specific data of the HiSeq2500 machine which generated prior and after each sequencing run. The NGS_LIMS database includes the Illumina Samplesheet, the First Base Report, the Runparameter and the Runinfo data from each sequencing run. In principal this database scheme can be applied to other Illumina sequencing machines such as the NextSeq, MiSeq or NovaSeq as well.
